# signup-form
Signup form is a project given by The Odin Project as part of their Intermediate HTML and CSS path.

In this project I'm going to showcase some of the new stuff I've learned over the course of the past few lessons in the course.
The project will be about a signup form for an imaginary service.

I used Flexbox for the general layout of the page, and flexbox also for every other component that needed positions changed to it, as it's the easiest by my opinion, given the situation and the needed components.

There is default form validation with the password forms required.
